#!/usr/bin/env bash
# next-version.sh -- prints the next semver tag for this module from the
# Conventional Commits since the latest v* tag, or prints nothing if no
# release is warranted. Used by .github/workflows/release.yml; run it locally
# to preview what a merge to main would release. Rules (RELEASING.md):
#
#   type!: / any "BREAKING CHANGE:" footer   -> minor (breaks a consumer: another
#                                               repo, the website); never major
#   feat: / any "Deprecated:" footer         -> minor (substantial feature, deprecation)
#   fix: / perf: / refactor: / revert: /     -> patch (small change or bug fix)
#   build: / chore(deps):
#   only chore/docs/test/ci/style            -> no release
#
#
# Majors are never automatic: a major is a product release (the website or
# the daml-escrow platform), cut by hand -- see RELEASING.md "Major releases".
#
# Usage: scripts/next-version.sh [range-end]   (default HEAD)
